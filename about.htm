                    I'm an Dutch Ethiopian, and have also lived in France where I have studied litterature as a degree.<br>
                After many other jobs outside the IT world I decided to get into coding.<br>
                I discovered <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"><div class="codenation">Codenation</div></a> through the internet and got lucky to be part of a 3 week course in web-development.<br>
                My main motivation is that we are in a digital era and I want to be part of this.<p></p>
